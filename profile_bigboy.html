      <h1>Profile : Big Boy Restaurant</h1>
      <p>During my time at PP+K, I worked with a few well-established brands. I became most familiar with Big Boy, a northern restaurant chain which began as a burger joint. Below are a sample of ads I worked on for various print mediums, such as newspapers, community handouts, and point-of-purchase displays.<br><br> Following that is a long-term project I was part of. Big Boy was approaching 80 years in business, and needed a new mark to represent the milestone. Three of us worked to develop marks, each exploring a variety of perspectives. I latched onto motifs representing the &#34;classic&#34; America, leading me to the 1950s, a bit later than the true 80-year mark, but better conveying the classic Americana Big Boy thrived from.<br><br> Below are the original explorations, and the distillations which followed. The approach we decided upon pulls visual cues from neon signs, the original symbol of drive-in burger joints when they first emerged on America&#39;s roadways. The final mark is one of three submitted to Big Boy for selection and further revisions.
